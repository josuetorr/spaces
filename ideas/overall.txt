Since we have a graph, we need to think in terms of mutation and queries. When we post to a user's inbox, what are we doing in terms of the graph? First of all, is it a node? I want to say yes.
An actor(node) HAS(edge) an inbox/outbox(node). A i/o (inbox/outbox) has pending activities(node)

for now, this is what we have:
  Nodes: - Actor
         - Inbox
         - Outbox

  Edges: - Activities, e.g alice FOLLOWS bob
                       e.g alice REPLIED_TO a post
         - Possesions, e.g alice HAS an inbox

How would our schema look like:
Schema
Type Actor {
  uid
  id
  firstname
  lastname
  preferredUsername
  email
  dob
}

id: string @index(hash) .
firstname: string @index(exact, term) .
lastname: string @index(exact, term) .
preferredUsername: string @index(exact, term) .
email: string @index(exact, term) .
